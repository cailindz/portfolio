### Cailin De Zeeuw's public portfolio for the Carnegie Mellon class **Telling Stories with Data**

## About Me
Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Cailin De Zeeuw, and I use she/her pronouns. I am a Master's student in Public Policy & Management at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. My professional interests include enviornmental policy, urban planning, and sustainable development, and I have found that both design and data analysis play important roles in making positive change in those fields. I consider myself a **maker**, and I am excited to practice making data visualizations. I look forward to seeing how my design and communication will improve throughout this course, and my hope is that this portfolio will illustrate my progress. 

## What I Hope to Learn
Under the What I hope to learn section, talk about what you're interested in getting out of the course and what you are planning to do once you graduate.  You can include other information you think is helpful to the rest of the class, including a photo if you like - follow the Github markdown guide to learn how.
