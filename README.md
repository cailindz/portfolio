## About Me!
<img align="left" width="132" height="142" src=headshot2.jpg>

Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Cailin De Zeeuw, and I use she/her pronouns. I am a Master's student in Public Policy & Management at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. My professional interests include enviornmental policy, urban planning, and sustainable development, and I have found that both design and data analysis play important roles in making positive change in those fields. I consider myself a *maker*, and I am excited to practice making data visualizations. I look forward to seeing how my design and communication will improve throughout this course, and my hope is that this portfolio will illustrate my progress. 

## What I Hope to Learn
I think data visualization is an exciting medium, since it combines principles of design, effective communication, and data analysis. I find each of these individually interesting and important, and am therefore eager to apply them to making effective and visually appealing data visualizations. My hope for this class is to develop my understanding of what makes a "good chart," and to produce a body of work that improves over time. To achieve this, I intend to practice analyzing data visualizations I come across in my life, and spend time iterating my own designs. Moving forward, I hope to continue practicing my data visualization skills in order to make creative, clear, and impactful charts in a professional setting.
