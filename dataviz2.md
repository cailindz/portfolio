## Bar Chart: Visualizing government debt data using data source interface
This bar chart was generated using the tools available on the OECD website. The visualization was created and customized without having to download the dataset.

## Grid of Line Charts: Using Flourish to visualize that same government debt data
This grid of line charts was generated using the Flourish web-based dataviz platform to illustrate the same data found on the OECD website above. Downloading a .csv file enabled the same data to be visualized using another platform.

## Line Chart: 
This line chart filtered by country was generated using Flourish as well. The visualization represents the same dataset used in the two charts above; however, the .csv file was manipulated to create a column for the "average" ratio. This information was already present in the dataset, and it was only restructured slightly to accomodate for a desired visual element.
