## Bar Chart: Visualizing government debt data using data source interface
This bar chart was generated using the tools available on the OECD website. The visualization was created and customized without having to download the dataset.

## Grid of Line Charts: Using Flourish to visualize that same government debt data
This grid of line charts was generated using the Flourish web-based dataviz platform to illustrate the same data found on the OECD website above. Downloading a .csv file enabled the same data to be visualized using another platform.

## Line Chart: 
This line chart filtered by country was generated using Flourish as well. The visualization represents the same dataset used in the two charts above; however, the .csv file was manipulated to create a column for the "average" ratio. This information was already present in the dataset, and it was only restructured slightly to accomodate for a desired visual element.

## Notes:
  While each of these charts was created using the same dataset, the unique ways of visualizing the data can communicate differently to a viewer. The bar chart shows how the debt-to-GDP ratio compares across different countries within the same year. This information is useful to someone who might be assessing a ranking of countries by debt or financial health, or understanding how different governments performed financially in a particular year (2020). In contrast, the grid of line charts communicates about how the debt-to-GDP ratio changed over time, for each country. This chart has a more "zoomed out" view of the data, compared to the bar chart that represented only a subset of the data. The grid of line charts is useful to someone interested in financial trends of countries. It represents all of the data, allowing a viewer to not only understand the trajectory of each country's debt-to-GDP ratio over time, but also compare across countries. This representation also communicates about where there is missing data, since some lines are shorter than others.
