## Selecting a data visualization for critique and redesign

I chose to critique and re-design one of many figures found in a report focusing on suburban-metro regions:
### [Overlooked Suburbs: The Changing Metropolitan Geography of Poverty in the Western United States<sup>1</sup>](https://www.frbsf.org/community-development/publications/community-development-research-briefs/2022/january/overlooked-suburbs-changing-metropolitan-geography-of-poverty-western-us/)

This report uses many data visualizations to help answer the motivating research questions. The report compares similar characteristics across different geographic regions, using separate but similar visualizations for each region, as well as several summarizing visualizations. The authors use figures to illustrate changing demographics and trends across time and in different geographic types. I chose to look closer at this report because of my interest in how the suburban context is changing. Changes in characteristics such as racial demographics and poverty have implications for planning and public policy in these areas. Within the report, I decided to focus on the figures depicting changing racial demographics, because I was interested in improving how multiple comparisons can be emphasized within one figure.

I chose to critique and redesign one of the figures specific to the Los Angeles metro region, which illustrates changes in racial demographics between 1990 and 2014-2018. A similar figure comparing racial demographics between these time periods is given for each metro region, for example Boise, Las Vegas, and Phoenix. Therefore, these critiques and suggestions could also apply to the other figures found in the report for different regions.

## Critiquing the Data Visualization

While the data visualization above isn't bad, I thought that I would be able to improve upon it. One of the issues that stood out to me was the challenge presented to the user when trying to compare data from the same year across different geographic types. Another issue I noticed was how the change in one color block affects the height of other color blocks, which can distort the pereception of changes in area of the bar, given only a change in placement along the bar. 

## Sketching Possible Alternatives
To address these issues, I thought about other chart types that could potentially be used to visualize the data. I proceeded with sketches of three different charts:
1. Overlapping histograms
2. Tree-map type charts
3. A grid of line charts

Please note that the sketches below are intended to convey design choices, not accurate data representation. Because each of these data visualization sketches uses repeated charts, some of the repeated elements are not entirely filled in, or the data used is a duplicate of a different geographic area. This was done only in the sketching phase, where I was most interested in design choices.

![Week 3-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117120584/202338731-6c830929-31bc-4fc0-a1b7-96a123e1f320.jpg)

**Option 1**
For the first option, I chose to try overlapping histograms. This data visualization is made up of six elements in a grid. Each element depicts a specific geographic type, for example "Largest city." Each element contains six spaces for bars -- one for each demographic race represented. However, each space was given two overlapping bars that represent values at different points in time. The overlapping characteristic meant that any visible color on top is the year that race had the highest representation, and anywhere the colors are mixed indicates overlap. 

**Option 2**
For the second option, I chose represent the population proportion visually within a square, in a type of tree map diagram. For the sketch, I drew six of the needed 12 squares for a complete grid. Each square was 10 x 10 units, so there were 100 spaces within each square. These spaces were filled in with color-coded area based on racial demographics of each geographic type for a specific point in time. I chose to represent the data this way to emphasize how different races made up parts of the whole population. 

## Testing Alternatives with User Feedback

After creating the three sketches above, I proceeded with interviewing peers to gain feedback on the sketches. I showed all three sketches to each user and asked them the following questions:
Seeing re-designs ONLY:
1. Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
2. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
3. Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
After seeing original:
4. How does the original compare to the re-designs? 
5. Is there anything you would change or do differently?

### Feedback from User 1
Fig. 1
1. A histogram of racial composition in Los Angelos metro region for different geographical areas as it changes from 1990 to 2018
2. No. Curious to see suburb data
3. Gov. Report - policy for diff. Demographics/who is representing regions
Fig. 2
1. Distribution of racial composition in 1990 and 2018 for different geographical regions
2. No
feedback: make it landscape to fit into a report better
Delineate rows so user can count up themselves
Fig. 3
1. Changing racial composition in each geographical region over time
2. Misleading/simplifying



### Feedback from User 2

## My Final Solution
  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently.
