# Assignment: Critique by Design
### *Due 11/15*
[Link to portfolio main page](/README.md)

## Selecting a data visualization for critique and redesign
1. A link to the original data visualization (or screenshot - make sure to correctly cite your sources, etc.).  Include paragraph or two on why you selected this particular data visualization.  For obvious reasons, the data visualization you select should come from a publicly accessible source. 
I chose to critique and re-design one of many figures found in a report focusing on suburban-metro regions:
### [Overlooked Suburbs: The Changing Metropolitan Geography of Poverty in the Western United States<sup>1</sup>](https://www.frbsf.org/community-development/publications/community-development-research-briefs/2022/january/overlooked-suburbs-changing-metropolitan-geography-of-poverty-western-us/)

This report uses many data visualizations to help answer the motivating research questions. The report compares similar characteristics across different geographic regions, using separate but similar visualizations for each region, as well as several summarizing visualizations. The authors use figures to illustrate changing demographics and trends across time and in different geographic types. 

I chose to critique and redesign one of the figures specific to the Los Angeles metro region, which illustrates changes in racial demographics between 1990 and 2014-2018. A similar figure comparing racial demographics between these time periods is given for each metro region, for example Boise, Las Vegas, and Phoenix. Therefore, these critiques and suggestions could also apply to the other figures found in the report for different regions.

## Part 2
2. For each step detailed above, you should document your progress as you moved forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently.

You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).
