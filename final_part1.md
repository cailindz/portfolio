What I want to say: The UN Sustainable Development Goals are a framework that can and should be employed across all sectors and levels to create wide-reaching, long-lasting change.
To Whom: Organizational leaders on a local scale

## Summary
A high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project.  

The intention is to continue zooming in from an international framework to local implementation. 
### Story Arc

## Outline & Initial Sketches
A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 

### Sustainable Development Goals: An International Framework

I will begin my project by giving an overview of the UN Sustainable Development Goals as a framework adopted by many countries. I will include the official SDG graphics, which are available for use according to these official [guidelines](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SDG_Guidelines_AUG_2019_Final.pdf). The overview will include highlights of some of the specific goals and the metrics used to assess progress toward those goals. All the SDGs are captured in this official graphic:

***Consider: Is it okay to include graphics I did not design, if they are central to the story?***

To summarize the overview of the SDGs, I can include an infographic-type visual calling out specific numbers:
- 17 goals
- 169 targets
- by 2030
- # of countries actively reporting SDG progress

Next, I will illustrate the international nature of the SDG framework while highlighting the United States. Here, I will include a dataviz illustrating how a number of countries are ranked along each of the 17 SDGs:![Untitled (Draft)-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117120584/203673359-a70e02eb-8999-4070-aa38-0554c9a7d16e.jpg)

### U.S. Progress on Sustainable Development Goals
In this section, I will focus on how the U.S. specifically has made progress on the SDGs, and where there is room for improvement. I will start with a simple (and boring) line chart illustrating the slight progress on the cumulative SDG Index Score since 2000:
![Untitled (Draft)-1 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117120584/203674380-05db2d7e-5a29-42a3-9234-5dcf1c2d2db5.jpg)

Next, I might highlight a few key areas where the U.S. is noticeably behind. The [State of the Sustainable Development Goals in the United States](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2022_Brookings_State-of-SDGs-in-the-US.pdf)<sup>1</sup> is a report published by Brookings that gives some insight. Based on their classification system of which SDGs are "on track" versus "breakthrough needed" or even "moving backward" I can color-code the U.S. progress in a dataviz:
![Untitled (Draft)-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117120584/203676178-c896d78c-f7f4-459c-9beb-8dcd0c282981.jpg)

I might also add a dataviz to illustrate how many people are affected by the U.S. falling short of an SDG even by a little bit. One fact highlighted in the Brookings report is that 6.6 million people did not have access to safe sanitation in 2019, which is approximately equal to the population of the state of Indiana.<sup>2<sup> I could use this fact or a different shortcoming in the U.S. and a unit chart to display how individual people in the U.S. are affected.

### SDGs on the Local Level
This section will highlight how cities apply the SDG Framework. [Pittsburgh and the Sustainable Development Goals: A Voluntary Local Review of Progress](https://sdgs.un.org/sites/default/files/2020-12/Pittsburgh%20VLR%202020%20Final%20Draft.pdf) is a report on how the City of Pittsburgh perceives themselves aligning with the SDGs as of 2020.<sup>3<sup> The report provides a small amount of data that can be used in a bar chart:

  ![Untitled (Draft)-3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117120584/203681086-582a0f0e-b6c3-4aeb-af1c-9134d8d6d519.jpg)

If extra detail is needed, I could also reference local SDG analysis from Los Angeles, California. The [LA Voluntary Local Review](https://sdg.lamayor.org/2021VLR) was a leader in local SDG reporting. Useful data can be found on their public website.

### SDGs on the Organizational Level
This section will be the most "zoomed in" I will go in terms of SDG action. The Carnegie Mellon University [2020 Voluntary Review of the Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.cmu.edu/leadership/the-provost/provost-priorities/sustainability-initiative/cmu-vur-2020.pdf) is a report detailing SDG alignment across CMU. I can use data visualizations to report out on how CMU is doing on meeting various SDGs, and also on how they conducted their evaluation. 

The evaluation process can be visualized using a flow chart. The following prototype captures a few of the steps, but will be further built out in a future iteration:
  ![Untitled (Draft)-4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117120584/203684300-69e4a4b1-0f36-4937-9d23-681ef294569a.jpg)

The report breaks down all of CMU's activities into the categories Education, Research, and Practice. The SDG evaluation then indicates what percentage of each category is connected with each specific SDG. The analysis was subjective and not entirely comprehensive. So, to visualize this data as a snapshot, a series of stacked bar charts could be useful. To further understand the data, plotting each percentage 
  
### Local Action Drives Global Impact
  

## Data
A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
