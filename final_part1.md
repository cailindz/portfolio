What I want to say: The UN Sustainable Development Goals are a framework that can and should be employed across all sectors and levels to create wide-reaching, long-lasting change.

## Summary
A high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project.  
### Story Arc

## Outline & Initial Sketches
A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.
