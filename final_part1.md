What I want to say: The UN Sustainable Development Goals are a framework that can and should be employed across all sectors and levels to create wide-reaching, long-lasting change.
To Whom: Organizational leaders on a local scale

## Summary
A high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project.  
### Story Arc

## Outline & Initial Sketches
A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 

### Sustainable Development Goals: An International Framework

I will begin my project by giving an overview of the UN Sustainable Development Goals as a framework adopted by many countries. I will include the official SDG graphics, which are available for use according to these official [guidelines](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SDG_Guidelines_AUG_2019_Final.pdf). The overview will include highlights of some of the specific goals and the metrics used to assess progress toward those goals. All the SDGs are captured in this official graphic:

**Consider: Is it okay to include graphics I did not design, if they are central to the story?**

To summarize the overview of the SDGs, I can include an infographic-type visual calling out specific numbers:
-17 goals
-169 targets
-by 2030
-# of countries actively reporting SDG progress

Next, I will illustrate the international nature of the SDG framework while highlighting the United States. Here, I will include a dataviz illustrating how a number of countries are ranked along each of the 17 SDGs:![Untitled (Draft)-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117120584/203673359-a70e02eb-8999-4070-aa38-0554c9a7d16e.jpg)


## Data
A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
