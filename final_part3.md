# Final Project Part 3

## Final Project Workflow Overview

### Part 1 Summary
In the Final Project Part 1, I was tasked with selecting my project topic, outlining my project, and identifying data sources to use for the project. While I thought of numerous topics of interest, I was most limited by data availability. Finding data was challenging for me, so I was excited to come across the [Sustainable Development Report](https://dashboards.sdgindex.org/downloads) website. Once I was inspired to explore the SDGs, I was able to find more information from different sources like the City of Pittsburgh and our own Carnegie Mellon University. 

By the end of Part 1, I defined my main message: "The UN Sustainable Development Goals are a framework that can and should be employed across all sectors and levels to create wide-reaching, long-lasting change." 

Somewhat surprisingly, my main message did not change much through the rest of the project process. My final report does represent how SDGs can be employed across different levels, from national to organizational. 

Part 1 also included several sketches of how I would represent my data. Although my final visualizations did not turn out exactly like my sketches, they were a good starting point and inspiration to begin iterating different charts.

### Part 2 Summary
In the Final Project Part 2, I had the chance to start building out my narrative more. I created a general structure in Shorthand and added wireframes. These wireframes were digital iterations of my previously hand-drawn sketches. During this step I was also intentional about identifying my target audience and tailoring the narrative and visuals to that audience. One strategy I used was creating "personas" of people I thought might be interested in my presentation. Another useful step was conducting interviews with users about each wireframe data visualization.

Part 2 of the project gave me the opportunity to both plan for next steps, and reflect on what I had already done. At the end of this part, I had a basic set-up for my story, and a list of action items to improve upon it. 

### Part 3 Behind-the-Scenes of the Final Data Story
## [Link to public data story](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/local-action-for-global-impact/index.html)
When I began Part 3 of the project, I started with the bare-bones Shorthand structure I outlined in Part 2, and some early iterations of my charts.  
*A few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II.  Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.  Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.*
