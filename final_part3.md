# Final Project Part 3

## Final Project Workflow Overview

### Part 1 Summary
In the Final Project Part 1, I was tasked with selecting my project topic, outlining my project, and identifying data sources to use for the project. While I thought of numerous topics of interest, I was most limited by data availability. Finding data was challenging for me, so I was excited to come across the [Sustainable Development Report](https://dashboards.sdgindex.org/downloads) website. Once I was inspired to explore the SDGs, I was able to find more information from different sources like the City of Pittsburgh and our own Carnegie Mellon University. 

By the end of Part 1, I defined my main message: "The UN Sustainable Development Goals are a framework that can and should be employed across all sectors and levels to create wide-reaching, long-lasting change." 

Somewhat surprisingly, my main message did not change much through the rest of the project process. My final report does represent how SDGs can be employed across different levels, from national to organizational. 

Part 1 also included several sketches of how I would represent my data. Although my final visualizations did not turn out exactly like my sketches, they were a good starting point and inspiration to begin iterating different charts.

### Part 2 Summary
In the Final Project Part 2, I had the chance to start building out my narrative more. I created a general structure in Shorthand and added wireframes. These wireframes were digital iterations of my previously hand-drawn sketches. During this step I was also intentional about identifying my target audience and tailoring the narrative and visuals to that audience. One strategy I used was creating "personas" of people I thought might be interested in my presentation. Another useful step was conducting interviews with users about each wireframe data visualization.

Part 2 of the project gave me the opportunity to both plan for next steps, and reflect on what I had already done. At the end of this part, I had a basic set-up for my story, and a list of action items to improve upon it. 

### Part 3 Behind-the-Scenes of the Final Data Story

#### Changes

*A few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II*
When I began Part 3 of the project, I started with the bare-bones Shorthand structure I outlined in Part 2, which included some early iterations of my charts.  

#### My Audience
*Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.)*
When I created the personas in Part 2, it helped me gain a better understanding of the diversity of audience members I wanted to appeal to. Specifically, what I think is challenging is to tailor a professional presentation to a variety of professions. Different fields have different communication styles, cultural norms, expectations, etc. In creating the personas, I realized that instead of targeting _any_ local organization, I was thinking more about _mission-driven_ organizations. I felt that this was a more accurate reflection of my goals for the presentation. It ruled out most businesses, but I did end up thinking through a persona of a real estate development professional who runs a mission-driven business. However, I think most of my audience would work for government or non-profit organizations. 

Because of this, I decided to include one government and one non-profit example in my final report. By emphasizing how a city and how a University have used the SDGs, I feel that my audience will be able to relate to at least one or the other. 

Another way I adjusted to my expected audience was simply in preparing to present in class. Given the setting, I decided I wanted to include a second "call to action" for the average local citizen, rather than just target local leaders. I feel that citizens, especially at the local level, have an impact on their communities. So, in advocating for sustainable community development within the framework of the SDGs, it made sense to include citizens in my audience. 

#### My Design Choices 
Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.* 
In the report, I intentionally used the color palette that the SDGs use. These colors appeared both in the official SDG graphics, but also in my font colors, chart bars, and background colors. While the colors are bold and bright, I tried to balance them out with white and grays. The "rainbow effect" was hard to avoid, especially in my figure that used CMU data. However, the consistency of the color coding from beginning to end made it easier to interpret, in my opinion.
