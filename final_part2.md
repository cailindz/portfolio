## Wireframes and Storyboarding
The current draft of my data story with wireframe data visualizations can be previewed [on Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/hWTlxeBEd0zlYx2A).

## User Research

### Target Audience
The target audience for my presentation includes organizational leaders doing mission-driven work on a local scale. This could include non-profit directors, government workers, local officials, small business owners, etc. Any person with organizational influence who is interested in bettering their community, and the world, might be interested in my presentation. 

## User Interviews
To gain useful feedback from interviews, I first had to identify individuals who are at least somewhat representative of my target audience. I was able to find three individuals representing the public health field, the energy sector, and the medical field. I was happy to have diverse representation from different industries; however, my interviewees were not diverse in age. To get a more representative sample of my target audience, I would need to interview individuals with greater experience in professional leadership roles, who are also likely to be older. However, I was limited by my access to willing participants and the relatively short time span available to conduct sufficient interviews.

### Interview Script
Once I identified interviewees, I was able to conduct interviews using a pre-defined script that aligns my goals and questions:

| Objective        | Question    
| -----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Define chart's   |- Can you tell me what this chart is saying?   |
| main message.    |- What is the main point of this chart?        |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|  
| Identify         |- How could you use this information?          |
| usefulness       |- How does this connect to your work?          |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Name any         |- What was most confusing about this chart?    |
| confusion        |- What changes would you make?                 |

### In-Class Critique Feedback
During the critique in class, I was given several suggestions for how to improve upon my wire-frame charts:
* Add reference points to first chart and reduce clutter of other countries
* Add average growth line to compare w/ US growth
* Use SDG icons on charts
* Add colors to column panels
* Use a Tableau dashboard to compare CMU graphs

## Key Findings
* It might be useful to refer to each SDG with a keyword, rather than by number
* Try re-arranging to emphasize trends, rather than the correct "order" of the SDGs
* The CMU graph is confusing and hard to interpret.

## Next Steps


## Personas
The following personas were created to represent a diverse group of organizational leaders across industries and sectors. Each is engaged in mission-driven work in some capacity, and each has a role that could exert influence on the organization. These personas are a limited and specific picture of what some of my audience-members might look like.

## Mood Board
The design of my presentation is based on the UN SDG graphic design style already in place. Because there are official graphics available for public use, I will use those and draw from their colors and fonts. Pictured here is a mood board illustrating the relevant colors, graphics, and fonts, as well as another image from Unsplash that lends inspiration. Overall, the aesthetic is bold and colorful with clear symbology and sharp lines.
