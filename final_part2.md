## Wireframes and Storyboarding
The current draft of my data story with wireframe data visualizations can be previewed [on Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/hWTlxeBEd0zlYx2A).

## User Research
You should have also developed a simple user research protocol that describes what you hope to find during your user interviews, including your research questions and the script.  Once your interviews are complete, you should have documented findings that detail what you've learned by showing your early wireframes / storyboards to at least three different individuals.  

Your user research protocol should clearly identify the following: 

a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story; 
b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview; 
c. your interview script; 
d. the findings from your interviews; and 
e. changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified. 

When talking about your findings, specific insights and observations, key quotes and other insights are better than broad, sweeping generalizations.  Look across your interviews and note where you have consistent feedback vs. any observations that might be conflicting.  Talk about how you plan on using this feedback to improve your project as you head into Part III. 


### Target Audience

## Personas
The following personas were created to represent a diverse group of organizational leaders across industries and sectors. Each is engaged in mission-driven work in some capacity, and each has a role that could exert influence on the organization. These personas are a limited and specific picture of what some of my audience-members might look like.

## Mood Board
The design of my presentation is based on the UN SDG graphic design style already in place. Because there are official graphics available for public use, I will use those and draw from their colors and fonts. Pictured here is a mood board illustrating the relevant colors, graphics, and fonts, as well as another image from Unsplash that lends inspiration. Overall, the aesthetic is bold and colorful with clear symbology and sharp lines.
